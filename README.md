## Description

This Simpsons game slightly mimicks the game memory, but with a twist.  The player chooses a card and then upon that action all of the cards get moved around.  The player has to remember not to choose the same card twice.  Each time the player chooses a new character card they get a point. Once they choose the same character card twice the game starts over.  Points are saved for the player that gets the highest number of correct cards.
